Analysis of NBA data from Kaggle

This was the final project for MA5790 (Predictive Modeling). I completed this project with Jason Blunk.

We used a dataset from Kaggle containing NBA data from 2014-2020. The goal of our project was to predict the winning team based on metrics collected early on in the season.

In this repo you'll find the dataset we used, our R code, and our final report.
